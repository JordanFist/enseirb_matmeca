# Rules of the game
This is a board game in which players must kill all the other players.
Each player initially has 50 life points, 1 mana point, and 1 gain point. In turn, players move around the board, draw a card, and play a card. The player can decide not to play a card to save mana. On each turn, players receive the number of mana points corresponding to their gain points.
Cards cost more or less in mana depending on their power.
If a player is surrounded by soft caramels he can no longer move, he dies.
The board is a toric board.
