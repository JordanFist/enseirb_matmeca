# Bus simulation

The goal of this project is to implement a bus simulation and then extend it to multiple means of transport such as a tram, etc.
There are stops and possibly passengers to pick up at these stops. The bus has a seating capacity and a standing capacity. The bus must have the necessary capacity to accommodate the new passenger knowing that each passenger has his own personality (For example, a passenger necessarily wants to be seated or then a passenger goes from sitting to standing at each stop, etc).

We also need to implement this solution in 2 ways.
