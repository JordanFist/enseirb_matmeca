# Factory
This is an Economic simulation game a bit like anno. the goal is to get as much gold as possible. For this, you can spend your gold in factories (eg. bread, sugar, wheat, etc.) which allow you to trade with other ingredients or gold. Buy the right and most profitable factories, but you only have a limited number of days to get as much gold as possible.
